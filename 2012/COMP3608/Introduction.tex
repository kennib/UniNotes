\section{Introduction}
	A system is rational if it does the "right thing" given what it knows (ideal concept of intelligence).
	\subsection{The Turing Test}
	A human asks writen questions and recieves back written responses.
	The computer passes if it is indistinguishable from a human.
	
	Replaces the philosophical question "Can machines think?" with a test of behaviour.
	An alternative to a long (and contreversial) list of qualifications.

	Things required for the Turing test
	Natural language processing
	Knowledge representation
	Automated reasoning
	Machine learning
	
	Total Turing Test
	Vision
	Robotics
	
	The Turing test is not focussed on as it is not a very practical problem.
	
	\subsection{Reverse Turing Test}
	CAPTCHA - Computer tests if you are human rather than a human testing if you are a computer.

	\subsection{Thinking Rationally}
	Take informal knowledge and make it formal.
	Especially difficult if knowledge is uncertain.
	Limited time and memory also make it neccessary to choose how to apply reasoning.
	
	\subsection{Acting Rationally}
	Maximizing a goal given the available information.

	\subsection{Strong and Weak AI}
	Weak AI - act intelligently but do not have a real concious mind.
	Strong AI - act intelligently and also have real concious minds.

	\subsection{Problem Solving and Search}
	\subsection{Game Playing}
	\subsection{Machine Learning}
