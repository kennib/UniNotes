\section{Analog IO}
	Continuous voltage corresponds to continuous range of values.
	Continuous range of values is transformed to discrete digital values.
	
	\subsection{Min and Max}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item VRH pin sets the high reference voltage.
			\item VRL pin sets the low reference voltage.
			\item The resolution is set by the number of bits (8 in this case).
		\end{itemize}
