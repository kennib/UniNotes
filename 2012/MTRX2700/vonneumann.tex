\subsection{Von Neumann Architectures}
	Von Neumann architectures are simple sequential architecture which performs the following cycle of events.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Fetch an instruction from memory
		\item Fetch any data required by the instruction from memory
		\item Execute the instruction (process the data)
		\item Store results in memory
		\item Return to 1.
	\end{enumerate}
