\section{Interrupts}
	Interrupts call interrupt service routines.
	Interupts save the current state, run the interupt service routine then restore the previous processor state.

	\subsection{Interrupt Vectors}
		There is predefined area in memory which can be used to reference where interrupt routines are for each interrupt source.
	
	\subsection{Interrupt Execution}
		Before an interrupt routine is called all CPU registers are saved.
		At the end of an interrupt service routine an RTI instruction should be used to restore the CPU registers to their previous states.

	\subsection{Interrupt Priority}
		Interrupts have predefined priorities used to determine the precedence of different interrupt sources.
		The Interrupts are queued and are executed as soon as the previous ISR is completed.

	\subsection{Interrupt Masking}
		Interrupts each have a mask bit that can be set in order to ignore the interrupt.
		A mask value of 0 tells the CPU to ignore the interrupt and 1 to call the ISR when the interrupt occurs.
