	\subsection{The Clock}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Clock pulses generated by an Oscillator
			\item Square wave (or close to)
			\item EVBPlus uses and external 8MHz clock
			\item Internally the clock is divided by 4, resulting in an E-Clock of 2MHz
			\item 1 Clock cycle takes 1/2MHZ = 500nSec
			\item Internal CPU operations are synched to clock pulses
		\end{itemize}
		
	\subsection{Memory}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Generally two types, ROM and RAM
			\item Accessed via a bus system
		\end{itemize}

	\subsection{I/O Registers}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Used for accessing I/O
			\item Write to registers to configure or to send out data
		\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{CPU}
		\subsubsection{Control Sequencer}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Used to co-ordinate data transfers to and from the CPU
				\item Logic governed by MicroPrograms, small sets of instruction built into the CPU
			\end{itemize}
